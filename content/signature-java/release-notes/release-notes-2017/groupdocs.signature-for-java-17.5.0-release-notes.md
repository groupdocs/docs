*   Introduced alternative Text Signature implementation as Watermark for all Document Types.
*   Introduced ability to specify measure units of Signature in millimeters for all Signature Types and Document Types.
*   Improved Signature Area positioning by ability to specify different measure units for location, size and margins properties
*   Optimized Signature processing for Words Documents
*   Introduced ability to put Text Signature into Form Fields of Words Documents
*   Introduced ability to put Text Signature into predefined fields for PDF Documents
*   Implemented verification of Text Signature for Form Fields of Words Documents
*   Implemented verification for Form Fields of Pdf Documents with Text Signature

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

{{< alert style="info" >}}This section lists public API changes that were introduced in GroupDocs.Signature for Java 17.5.0. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in GroupDocs.Signature which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.{{< /alert >}}

1.  Added new enumeration value **Millimeters** for enumeration** MeasureType** to specify measure units in millimeters for location, size of margins. See different examples here    
[How to specify different Measure Units]({{< ref "signature-java/developer-guide/advanced-usage/signing/locating-signature-on-document-page/locating-signature-on-page-with-different-measure-units.md" >}})

      2. Following static method of SignatureHandler are marked as Obsolete attribute and will be deprecated after next 3 Releases

**Obsolete static methods of SignatureHandler**

```csharp
public static DocumentDescription getPageDescriptions(string guid);
public static byte[] getDocumentPageImage(String guid, Integer width, Integer quality, int pageIndex);
public static java.awt.Dimension getPageSize(String guid, int signaturePageNumber, double signatureLocationX, 
double signatureLocationY, PositionInCellsDocument positionInCellsDocument);
```

       3. Introduced non static methods to obtain Document information to SignatureHandler class. More examples are located here

           [How to obtain information about document](https://docs.groupdocs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=46858855)

       4. Added new enumeration for Text Signature Implementation for each enumeration type like CellsTextSignatureImplementation,

           PdfTextSignatureImplementation, WordsTextSignatureImplementation and SlidesTextSignatureImplementation - **Watermark**. 

       5. Added new enumeration for Text Signature Implementation for Words Documents WordsTextSignatureImplementation **TextToFormField. **

### Specify different Measure Unit Types for PDF Text Signature

{{< alert style="info" >}}New Measure Unit Type MeasureType.Millimeters is supported starting from version 17.5{{< /alert >}}
