It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in GroupDocs.Signature which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.{{< /alert >}}

1.  Added new public interfaces. IRectangle interface describes Signature Area with Left, Top, Width and Height. IAlignment interface describes Alignment and Margins of Signature Area. IRotation interface describes Rotation property of Signature Area. IOpacity interface describes opacity value for Signature appearance Existing Signature Options like SignTextOptions, SignImageOptions and SignDigitalOptions implement these interfaces. 
2.  Added new enumeration type for Pdf Signature Implementation - Sticker. For Pdf Sticker Implementation new class PdfTextStickerAppearance was added to describe additional properties of Sticker area appearance on page. Added new enumeration types PdfTextStickerIcon to describes available values for Pdf Text Sticker Icon Appearance and PdfTextStickerState to describe initial state of Sticker on page.
3.  Updated public classes for Pdf Text Signature Verifications to verify Stamp, Sticker and [TextAnnotation](https://docs.groupdocs.com/display/signaturejava/Signing+Pdf+Documents+with+Text+Signature#SigningPdfDocumentswithTextSignature-SignPdfdocumentwithTextSignatureasAnnotation) [implementation separately](https://docs.asposeptyltd.com/display/signaturejava/Signing+Pdf+Documents+with+Text+Signature#SigningPdfDocumentswithTextSignature-VerificationofPDFDocumentwithTextSignatureAnnotation)
