There might be the case when your document is not physically located on the disk. Instead, you have the document in the form of a stream. In this case, to avoid the overhead of saving stream as a file on disk, [**GroupDocs.Viewer**](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/java) enables you to render the file streams directly.

The following are the steps to be followed:

*   Specify the method to obtain document stream; 
*   Pass method's name to [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/java/viewer/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer) class constructor.

Following code snippet serves this purpose.

```csharp
		FileInputStream fileSteream = new FileInputStream("sample.docx");
        HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources();

        Viewer viewer = new Viewer(fileSteream);
        viewer.view(viewOptions);
        viewer.close();


```
