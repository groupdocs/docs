### Why To Migrate?

  
Here are the key reasons to use the new updated API provided by GroupDocs.Viewer for Java since version 19.11:

*   **Viewer** class introduced as a **single entry point** to manage the document rendering process to any supported file format (instead of **ViewerHtmlHander** / **ViewerImageHander** classes from previous versions). 
    
*   The overall **rendering speed improved **dramatically by saving rendered page as soon as it was rendered, not when all pages list were rendered. 
    
*   Product architecture was redesigned from scratch in order to **decreased memory usage **(from 10% to 400% approx. depending on the document type).
    
*   Document **viewing options simplified** so it’s easy to instantiate proper options class and control over document rendering and saving processes.  
      
    

### How To Migrate?

Here is a brief comparison of how to display document into HTML form using old and new API.  

**Old coding style**

```csharp
ViewerHtmlHandler htmlHandler = new ViewerHtmlHandler();

HtmlOptions options = new HtmlOptions();
options.setEmbedResources(true);

List<PageHtml> pages = htmlHandler.getPages("sample.docx", options);
```

**New coding style**

```csharp
        Viewer viewer = new Viewer("sample.docx");
        viewer.view(HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources());
        viewer.close();
```
