## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

{{< alert style="info" >}}This section lists public API changes that were introduced in GroupDocs.Comparison for Java 19.6. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in GroupDocs.Comparison which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.{{< /alert >}}

1.  Use "DiagramMasterSetting" to manage masters of the Comparison.Diagram.
    
    ```csharp
    setMasterPath(String);// - User set custom master path
    setUseSourceMaster(boolean);// - true - use master from source and target together, false - use default or custom master
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    *   UseSourceMaster – false without MasterPath - use default master path
    *   UseSourceMaster – false with MasterPath - use custom master path
    *   UseSourceMaster – true - use master from source and target documents together
    
    Use "OriginalSize" to set document size when comparing image with different formats, this size will be used when document is converted to the picture.
    
    ```csharp
    OriginalSize -> setWidth(...);// int
    OriginalSize -> setHeigth(...);// int;
    ```
    
      
    
2.  Inserted, deleted and style changed items styles setting used for set font color, highlight color , styles(bold, italic, underline, strike through) and tags for marked changes in result document.
    
    ```csharp
    settings.getInsertedItemsStyle().setFontColor(Color.getBrown());
    settings.getInsertedItemsStyle().setHighlightColor(Color.getRed());
    settings.getInsertedItemsStyle().setBeginSeparatorString("<inserted>");
    settings.getInsertedItemsStyle().setEndSeparatorString("</inserted>");
    ```
    
    ```csharp
    settings.getDeletedItemsStyle().setFontColor(Color.getAquamarine());
    settings.getDeletedItemsStyle().setHighlightColor(Color.getBlue());
    settings.getDeletedItemsStyle().setBeginSeparatorString("<deleted>");
    settings.getDeletedItemsStyle().setEndSeparatorString("</deleted>");
    ```
    
    ```csharp
    settings.getStyleChangedItemsStyle().setFontColor(Color.getAqua());
    settings.getStyleChangedItemsStyle().setHighlightColor(Color.getGreen());
    settings.getStyleChangedItemsStyle().setBeginSeparatorString("<style>");
    settings.getStyleChangedItemsStyle().setEndSeparatorString("</style>");
    ```
    
      
    
3.   Getting Image representation of document pages.
    
    ```csharp
    Comparer comparer = new Comparer();
    ComparisonSettings cs = new ComparisonSettings();
    cs.setStyleChangeDetection(true);
     
     
    //compare document
    ICompareResult result = comparer.compare(sourcePath, targetPath, cs);
    result.saveDocument(resultPath);
     
     
    //get list of pages
    List<PageImage> resultImages = comparer.convertToImages(resultPath);
     
     
    //save them as bitmap to separate folder
    if (!new File(savePath + "/Result Pages").exists()) 
       new File(savePath + "/Result Pages").mkdir();
     
     
    for (PageImage image : resultImages)
    { 
         BufferedImage bitmap = ImageIO.read(image.getPageStream()); 
         ImageIO.write(bitmap, "png", new FileOutputStream(savePath + "/Result Pages/result_" + image.getPageNumber() + ".png")); 
    }
    ```
